To speed up rendering, you might want to try these tips.

POSTGRESQL
==========
In /etc/postgresql/X.Y/main/postgresql.conf:

* shared_buffers: 75% of the available RAM => rather 500MB than 32MB
* work_mem: 16MB rather than 1MB
* wal_buffers: 1MB rather than 64kb
* chekpoint_segments: 6 rather than 3
* random_page_cost: 2 rather than 4

For osmqa, we also recommend:
* autovacuum = off

Remember to restart Postgresql after each configuration change.
And, of course, it's better to measure rendering time each time a parameter has been modified.

After setting shared_buffers to a higher value, postgresql will probably complain and refuse to restart.
In that case, add this line to /etc/sysctl.conf (here for 512MB) :
 kernel.shmmax = 536870912
Then: 
 sudo sysctl -p

MAPSERVER
=========
Use fastCGI rather than CGI if you can
